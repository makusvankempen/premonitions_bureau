## The British Premonitions Bureau

The **British Premonitions Bureau** was formed in 1966 by psychiatrist [[John Barker]] after the [[Aberfan disaster|Aberfan mining disaster]], in which 144 people, including 116 children, died. The disaster occurred when 500,000 tons of debris smashed through the Welsh town and buried the primary school. Reports of [[precognitive]] dreams foretelling the catastrophe prompted Barker to form the bureau in hopes of predicting and avoiding future tragedies.

In the 18 months the Premonitions Bureau was open, nearly 1,000 reports of premonitions were collected. While a few seemed to foretell disasters, over 90 percent failed to predict future events, and none prevented any disasters.

## History

John Barker worked as a psychiatrist at [[Shelton Hospital]], a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Lunatic asylum|asylum]] housing people considered "unfit" to live in society. While Barker pushed for reforms to improve conditions, he engaged in unconventional research such as [[aversion therapy]], which used electric shocks to discourage "undesirable" behavior, including addiction, homosexuality, and transvestitism.{{R|"NYT"}}{{R|"NPR"}}

Barker was a member of The [[Society for Psychical Research]] and interested in unorthodox ideas, especially apparent [[prophecies]].{{R|"Psychologist"}} Around the time of the Aberfan disaster in [[Wales]], Barker worked on a book called *Scared To Death*. Earlier, the head of psychology at [[Harvard Medical School]], [[Walter Cannon]], coined the term "voodoo death"{{R|"Psych Today"}} to describe a response of "primitive people" dying of fear. Based on Cannon's concept, Barker argued that hearing a premonition of one's death may result in a deep fear that could affect the body's immune system and result in death.{{R|"New Sci"}} {{R|"Paranorm"}} After the disaster, he heard of a boy who escaped in Aberfan but later died of [[Acute stress disorder|shock]].<ref name="New Sci" />

Barker visited the Aberfan disaster site and noted that several people seemed to escape death by [[coincidence]], such as missing their bus or sleeping in late.<ref name="Psychologist" /> Bereaved families spoke of dreams and [[portents]]. On the eve of the disaster, a young boy named Paul Davies had reportedly drawn figures digging in the hillside under the words “The End”. Davies died in the school. A young girl named Eryl Mai Jones reportedly told her mother that she was not afraid to die, two weeks before the collapse.{{R|"New Yorker"}}

A different account of the girl was later published by Barker. In this version, which had been signed by her parents and attested by a local minister, Jones told her mother about a dream where she went to school, but the school "wasn't there" because "something black had come down all over it". According to the report, the next day the girl was among the dead in Aberfan.{{R|"Paranorm"}}

While touring Aberfan and hearing various stories of foreboding, Barker wanted to investigate whether the claims could be evidence of precognition, and he contacted science journalist for [[London]]'s *Evening Standard*, [[Peter Fairley]]. They invited the newspaper's readers to contact Barker with their 'dreams and forebodings'.<ref name="New Sci" /> While Barker and Fairley received many responses, they knew the reports had little value as [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] of precognition because they were created after the event.<ref name="Psychologist" />

## Formation of the Bureau

John Barker wanted to use claims of precognition to predict and hopefully avert future disasters. Barker and Fairley created a 'Premonitions Bureau' and invited the public to report experiences that they thought might predict future events.<ref name="Psychologist" /> Fairley had a timestamp made, and the reports were carefully cataloged<ref name="New Yorker" /> and set up with an 11-point system:

* 5 points for "unusualness"
* 5 points for accuracy
* 1 point for timeliness

In theory, the Premonitions Bureau would be a repository for "mass premonitions" to detect patterns suggesting a possible date, nature, or place of an upcoming disaster.<ref name="New Yorker" />

During its first year, the bureau collected 469 predictions.<ref name="New Yorker" /> In one "hit," Alan Hencher, a switchboard operator, predicted a plane crash involving 123 people. Nine days later, a plane crashed near [[Nicosia]] in [[Cyprus]], killing 124 people on impact. Another came from music teacher Kathleen Lorna Middleton, who wrote about a vision of a petrified astronaut. Earlier that day, [[Vladimir Komarov]] was killed when the [[Soyuz 1]] capsule crash-landed in Russia, but the incident wasn't reported until later.<ref name="New Sci" /> Middleton also sent a warning about American Senator [[Robert Kennedy]] on March 11, 1968, and reportedly called the Premonitions Bureau three times on June 4.<ref name="New Yorker" /> Kennedy was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]], having been shot on June 5, 1968, and died the following day.

Meanwhile, Barker's psychiatric work overwhelmed him as the conditions at Shelton became intolerable. His trip to the United States to promote his book was miserable, and both Hencher and Middleton predicted that he would soon die.<ref name="NYT" /> In 1967, Hencher contacted Barker about his prediction,<ref name="Paranorm" /> and Middleton warned him of a dream "that may mean death." <ref name="Psych Today" />

Barker, who in his late thirties, suffered "emotional stress almost to the point of 'crack up'" and left his previous job as the superintendent of a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental hospital]] in [[Dorset]],<ref name="New Yorker" /> was [[depression (mood)|depressed]] and believed his end was near. He died in August 1968, 18 months after starting the bureau, <ref name="NYT" /> of a brain [[embolism]], not by a “gas supply” or “a dark car” as one psychic had suggested.<ref name="SI" /> On the morning before, Middleton reported that she woke up with a choking sensation and called out for help.<ref name="Psych Today" />

Shortly after Barker's death, the Premonitions Bureau closed.<ref name="New Yorker" /> In the 18 months of the bureau's existence, 723 predictions were collected, and 18 were recorded as hits, with 12 of those coming from only two correspondents, Hencher and Middleton.<ref name="New Sci" /> No disasters were prevented.<ref name="Paranorm" />

## Critical Review

The premise of the Premonitions Bureau has been evaluated by [[Scientific skeptic|skeptics]] and psychologists. [[Joe Nickell]] has pointed out several issues with premonitions, including:

* Premonitions reported after events cannot be considered evidence since they may be mental [[confabulation]]s constructed after the fact.
* Prediction accounts can be misleading in detail.
* Some premonition stories may be altered over time.
* A prediction made in advance may be interpreted and reconstructed after an event to fit the event's details better. Also, the person doing the retrofitting may be seeking credit for premonition details that were not specified.
* The problem of determining probability. There is no way to evaluate how dreams run counter to [[statistical]] laws.{{R|"SI"}}

[[Michael Shermer]] explains that precognitive dreams are formed by how the human brain is designed to see [[Apophenia|patterns]] and not randomness. Given the number of people dreaming each night, odds are that someone will have a [[dream]] about somebody dying who actually dies soon after. But the many dreams where somebody dying didn't come true are quickly forgotten. The dreamer remembers the "hit" not the misses.{{R|"Guard"}}

In his book [[Paranormality (book)|*Paranormality: Why we see what isn't there* ]], [[Richard Wiseman]] discusses how, based on the work by [[Eugene Aserinsky]], sleep scientists found that people have an average of four dreams a night and forget most of their dreams upon waking. People usually remember dreams only if they wake during the dreaming episode. Even then, they remember mostly fragments and soon forget them unless they are remarkable.{{R|"Paranorm"}}

Because people have many dreams based on various events from their waking lives, occasionally, a dream may seem relevant to a particular event when it is due to the [[laws of probability]]. [[Somnology|Sleep scientists]] further discovered that around 80% of dreams are about negative events. Therefore, bad news will more likely trigger a memory of a corresponding dream, which may explain why many reported premonitions seem to be about death and disasters.{{R|"Paranorm"}}
